**Assignment notebook:** https://github.com/vincentwenger/bank_deposit_subscription/blob/main/prompt_III.ipynb

## What is the problem?
The goal is to predict if a client will subscribe a term deposit at the bank

## What is the data?
The data is a dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone. It comes from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
The data is from a Portuguese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. 
The dataset collected is related to 17 campaigns that occurred between May 2008 and November 2010, corresponding to a total of 79354 contacts.
It contains 41188 rows and 21 columns.

## What are the findings?

The findings are that :
- we can predict the price of the car based on the attribute "year", "cylinders", "odometer". When analyzing the data we noticed that the average of price are :
- higher in UT, cheaper in ME
- higher for white car, cheaper for green car
- higher for pickup, cheaper for mini-van
- higher for full_size, cheaper for compact
- higher for 4wd drive and cheaper for fwd drive
- the transmission type doesn't seem to impact too much the price
- higher for lien title_status and cheaper for parts only or salvage
- higher for diesel fuel and cheaper for hybrid fuel
- higher in general for more cylinders
- higher when condition is new, cheaper when condition is fair or salvage
- higher for ferrari and cheaper for toyota

## What do I recommend?

- It is better to buy white cars
- We recommend to install a car dealership un Utah as we will be able to make more money selling cars
- It is better to buy more full size pick-ups with 4wd drive, with as many cylinders as possible
- It is recommended to buy new car working with diesel
